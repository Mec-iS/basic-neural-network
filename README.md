# Basic Nerural Network with backpropagation

## Overwiew
A very basic neural network's units and gates implementation in Python, ported from JS code in [Karphaty's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) with some additions.

It implements basic unit and gates classese based on binary and linear operations.

## Running
* Install Python3.4+ with `numpy` 
* From the main directory run `python -m unittest discover tests`.
